        <p><strong>My name is Oglesby Rodriguez, and I am currently on an exciting journey into the world of coding. As someone who is new to this field, I have taken the leap to enroll in a boot camp, where I am learning the essential skills needed to thrive in this ever-evolving industry.

Throughout my boot camp experience, I have gained exposure to various programming languages, frameworks, and development tools. This hands-on learning approach has allowed me to build foundational knowledge, while also pushing me to challenge myself with real-world coding projects.

I am driven by my passion for technology and my determination to succeed. My goal is to continuously improve my coding abilities and eventually establish myself as a skilled developer, ready to tackle any challenge the industry presents.</strong></p>
